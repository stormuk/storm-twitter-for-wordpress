Twitter API 1.1 compliant plugin that provides a function to get an array of tweets from the auth'd users Twitter feed for use in themes.

== Description ==

A Twitter API 1.1 compliant wordpress plugin that provides an array of a users timeline from Twitter for use by theme developers.

The new Twitter API requires you be oAuth'd before you can request a list of tweets, this means that all of the existing Twitter plugins that simply make an AJAX request for to the JSON API endpoint will break as of March 2013. 

This is a major problem for the vast majority of websites that are currently using twitter, so we built a PHP class that implements all the new requirements for authentication and gives you an array of tweets out of the other end, for you to use in your PHP applications, or WordPress theme.  You can find the stand-alone [StormTwitter](https://github.com/stormuk/storm-twitter) class on GitHub

This plugin wraps our Twitter class and provides a settings screen for easy integration into WordPress.  However, it's definitely for developers - you only get a PHP array out of it that contains Twitter tweet objects. You'll still need to style the output and make it comply with the new display requirements.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin using the plugin manager, or upload the files to your wp-content/plugins directory.

Navigate to the Settings > Twitter Feed Auth.

Here you'll find settings fields to authenticate with Twitter.  You'll need to create a new Application on http://dev.twitter.com/apps.

Once you've create the app, scroll down the app's details page to find the oAuth section.  Copy the consumer secret and consumer key into the settings page for the plugin.  Then click the Create Access Token button at the bottom of the Twitter app page.  Copy the Access token and Access token secret into the plugin's settings page.  Finally, enter the Twitter username of the feed you want to access.  Save the settings.

Now, anywhere in your theme files you can call the `getTweets()` function to retrieve an array of tweets.

You can then loop over the array and do whatever you want with it.

    `<?php
      $tweets = getTweets($number_of_tweets, $twitter_screenname_to_load, $optional_array_of_any_additional_twitter_api_parameters);
      var_dump($tweets);

      foreach($tweets as $tweet){
        var_dump($tweet);
      }
    ?>`

You can specify a number of tweets to return (up to 20) by passing a parameter to the function.  For example, to display just the latest tweet you'd request `getTweets(1)`

The following default options are used unless you override them in the optional array of additional parameters.

* Trim the user object ("trim_user" => true)
* Exclude replies ("exclude_replies" => true)
* Exclude retweets ("include_rts" => false)

Results are cached for 1 hour (by default) to help you avoid hitting the API limits.
